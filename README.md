Yarrrhhh fellas!

We need your help to fight the bug infestation on our spaceship, it seems a portal appeared out of no where and those buggers keep coming endlessly.

How so you might ask? Well that's easy, the more bugs you kill, the richer you get. Feel free to reinvest that sweet gold into more defense systems. We will need it!

Hints:
- Select from the shop what you want to build, and then place it by left clicking on the grid;
- **Turrets needs to be placed on top of a pre-existing wall**;
- You can sell walls and turrets at any time by right clicking on the item you wish to remove, you get your full investment back into your bank!

Have a great time fighting buggers!!
