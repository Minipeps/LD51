# LD51 - Theme: Every 10 seconds

something switches

platform game? with obstacle that appear/disappear

rythm game?

the progress of the game resets every 10s (the player position gets reset), you have to reach certain objectives in that time

sound design: clock ticking?

every 10s you gain something (money, new abilities, more stats), game becomes harder

survival game, your health/gun only recharges every 10s, count your shots wisely!
short levels with waves of enemies: chose to survive at the end of the level

## Tower defense

tower defense style ? new waves every 10s, don't get overwhelmed -> no pause (as you traditionnaly would have)

- 2d tiled map (single map)
- player can buy/build wall
- player can buy/build turrets (count as a wall)
- player can directly attack the enemies (2d character that moves or godgame?)
- point and click (limited use of keyboard - easier for web deployment)
- upgrades ?
- sound design: enemy attacks on sync with the rythm of the game (every 10s ?)
  - the more ennemies, the more sound (advanced)
- IA: using A* pathfinding algorithm? (or maybe unity builtin if exists)
- In case of 2d character moving: each wave there are some bonus that you can try to collect, but their positions changes every 10s
- color of the enemy define its rank (health points + money gains)
